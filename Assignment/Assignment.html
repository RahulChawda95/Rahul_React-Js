            The React.js framework is an open-source JavaScript framework and
            library developed by Facebook. It's used for building interactive
            user interfaces and web applications quickly and efficiently with
            significantly less code than you would with vanilla JavaScript.
            <br />
            In React, you develop your applications by creating reusable
            components that you can think of as independent Lego blocks. These
            components are individual pieces of a final interface, which, when
            assembled, form the application's entire user interface.

          NPM is short for node package manager, an online directory that
          contains the various already registered open-source packages. NPM
          modules consume the various functions as a third-party package when
          installed into an app using the NPM command <i> npm install.</i>
          <br />
          Third-party NPM modules are the unit of logic for a specific
          functionality or a full-fledged library,

          Some of the reasons why you should use Node JS together with React JS
          to make your code scalable and highly efficient include:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b> Real-time Data:</b> Using Node JS is highly recommended for a
              constant server connection if the core of your application is
              based on real time data management or streaming.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b> High Server Load:</b> Using Node JS with React can help in
              handling requests and maintaining server load balance. JSON APIs:
              You can easily build JSON APIs for your application using Node JS.
              The reusability of the code enables sharing within React JS.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>MERN Stack:</b> You can use the MERN stack, including MongoDB,
              Express, React and Node JS to use both together.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Single page applications:</b> Single page applications are best
              built using React js with Node js for robust backend, lightweight
              app and asynchronous data loading through callback functions.
            </li>

            React have its own CLI but currently they are only supporting
            creating an app (create-react-app). create-react-app used to
            generate the boilerplate version of a React application thru command
            line.

            A Component is considered as the core building blocks of a React
            application. It makes the task of building UIs much easier. Each
            component exists in the same space, but they work independently from
            one another and merge all in a parent component, which will be the
            final UI of your application.
            <br />
            Every React component have their own structure, methods as well as
            APIs. They can be reusable as per your need. For better
            understanding, consider the entire UI as a tree. Here, the root is
            the starting component, and each of the other pieces becomes
            branches, which are further divided into sub-branches.
          </p>
          <p>In ReactJS, we have mainly two types of components. They are</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Class Component</li>
            <li>Function Component</li>
          </ul>

            <b>Header In ReactJs:</b>Headers are compositions that extend
            standard navbar functionalities. They contain additional components
            like a jumbotron, sub-navbar, or image covers which serve as a
            containers for extra navigation elements - usually links, forms, or
            call-to-action buttons.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Content Component:</b>Components are independent and reusable
            bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions,
            but work in isolation and return HTML. Components come in two types,
            Class components and Function components, in this tutorial we will
            concentrate on Function components.

          <b>Installation Reactjs on Windows:</b>
          <p>
            <b> Step 1:</b> Install Node.js installer for windows. Click on
            Official Website. Here install the LTS version (the one present on
            the left). Once downloaded open NodeJS without disturbing other
            settings, click on the Next button until it's completely installed.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 2:</b> Open command prompt to check whether it is completely
            installed or not type the command ->
          </p>
          <pre><b>  node -v</b></pre>

          <pre> <b> npm install -g create-react-app</b></pre>
          <p>
            It will globally install react app for you. To check everything went
            well run the command
