            Redux is an open-source JavaScript library used to manage
            application state. React uses Redux for building the user interface.

            Thunk is a logical concept in programming where you deal with a
            function that is primarily used to delay the calculation or
            evaluation of any operation. <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            ReduxThunk acts as a middleware that will return you a function
            instead of an object while calling through the action creators. The
            returned function receives the dispatch method from the store and
            then later it is used to dispatch synchronously inside the body of
            function once the asynchronous actions have been completed. Let's
            move ahead with ReduxThunk and talk more about its installation and
            usage.

          PureComponent is similar to Component but it skips re-renders for same
          props and state. Class components are still supported by React, but we
          donâ€™t recommend using them in new code.
          <p><b>Usage </b></p>
          <p>Skipping unnecessary re-renders for class components</p>
          <p>
            React normally re-renders a component whenever its parent
            re-renders. As an optimization, you can create a component that
            React will not re-render when its parent re-renders so long as its
            new props and state are the same as the old props and state. Class
            components can opt into this behavior by extending
            <b>PureComponent:</b>

        <td>
          <p>
            The second argument that can optionally be passed to setState is a
            callback function which gets called immediately after the setState
            is completed and the components get re-rendered.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want your program to update the value of a state using
            setState and then perform certain actions on the updated value of
            state then you must specify those actions in a function which should
            be the second argument of the setState. If we would not do so then
            those actions will be performed on the previous value of state
            because of asynchronous nature of setState.
